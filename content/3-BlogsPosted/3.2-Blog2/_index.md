# Reducing AWS Infrastructure Costs by up to 60% for Start-ups and Businesses

When deploying and operating systems on AWS, **cost optimization** is a major priority for both Cloud engineers and businesses.

This post presents three practical strategies for AWS infrastructure cost optimization: **compute optimization**, **storage lifecycle management**, and **automated scheduling for Dev/Test resources**.

> Savings percentages are maximums or estimates for specific scenarios. Actual results depend on the workload, Region, configuration, purchase model, and usage schedule.

## 1. Optimize compute with AWS Graviton and Savings Plans

Compute services such as EC2, ECS, and EKS often represent a large share of an AWS bill. Two complementary approaches are:

- **Migrate to AWS Graviton:** ARM-based instance families such as T4g, C6g, and M6g use processors designed by AWS. According to AWS, Graviton can provide up to 40% higher performance at up to 20% lower cost than comparable x86 instances for certain workloads. Test ARM compatibility, native dependencies, and application performance before moving production workloads.
- **Use Savings Plans or Reserved Instances:** steady 24/7 workloads can commit to a consistent level of usage for one or three years. Compute Savings Plans can reduce costs by up to 66% compared with On-Demand pricing while retaining flexibility across EC2, Fargate, and Lambda under the plan's conditions.

## 2. Manage storage with Amazon S3 Lifecycle

Unclassified long-lived data can make S3 costs increase over time. S3 Lifecycle Rules can align storage classes with access patterns:

- **S3 Standard:** for new or frequently read and written data.
- **S3 Standard-IA / One Zone-IA:** for infrequently accessed data that still requires millisecond retrieval. Consider minimum storage duration, retrieval fees, and availability requirements before transitioning objects.
- **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval / Glacier Deep Archive:** for backups, logs, and long-term archives that do not need real-time access. S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage can start at approximately `USD 0.00099/GB-month` in some Regions; pricing and retrieval charges vary by Region.

When access patterns are unknown, consider **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**. It monitors access patterns and automatically moves eligible objects between access tiers, with a monitoring and automation charge.

## 3. Automatically stop and start Dev/Test resources

Development and staging environments are often only used during business hours. **AWS Instance Scheduler** or **Lambda with EventBridge** can reduce overnight and weekend compute charges by scheduling resources to:

- Stop EC2 and RDS at `19:00` each day.
- Start them again at `08:00` the next morning.

For an eight-hour day and five-day work week, this approach can reduce the compute portion of non-production costs by approximately 65–70%. Storage, backups, Elastic IP/public IPv4 addresses, and related resources might still incur charges. An RDS DB instance can remain stopped for only seven days before AWS automatically restarts it.

## Conclusion

AWS cost optimization is a continuous process rather than a one-time task. Combine **AWS Cost Explorer** for trend analysis, **AWS Budgets** for alerts, and CloudWatch for right-sizing to maintain active control of the budget.
