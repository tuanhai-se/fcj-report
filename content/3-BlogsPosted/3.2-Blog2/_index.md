# From architecture diagram to ECS Fargate with Terraform

EduFlow infrastructure does not aim to use the most AWS services. It maps each operational need to one clear component.

## Module boundaries

| Module            | Role                                                      |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `vpc`             | VPC, public subnets, and private data subnets             |
| `security-groups` | Permit only ALB → apps and backend → RDS                  |
| `alb`             | TLS/HTTP entry point, health checks, and `/api/*` routing |
| `ecs`             | Cluster, ECR, task definitions, and Fargate services      |
| `rds`             | MySQL, subnet group, backups, and monitoring role         |
| `secrets-manager` | Database, SMTP, JWT, and VNPay runtime values             |
| `s3`              | Asset/backup bucket with public access blocked            |

## Delivery flow

GitHub Actions runs tests and `terraform validate`, signs in to ECR, builds both images tagged with the commit SHA, pushes them, and forces new ECS deployments. The SHA provides exact traceability; `latest` supports simple operations.

## Cost decisions

The dev environment uses low desired counts, Single-AZ RDS, and no modules absent from the architecture. This is intentional: control MVP cost while preserving `multi_az` and desired-count inputs for future availability requirements.

## Conclusion

Good Terraform is executable documentation. Module names, inputs/outputs, and security groups should communicate the architecture without reading every resource.
