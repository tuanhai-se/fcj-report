enrollment**. [Stored JSON](https://github.com/L1nkinPark/EduFlowPlatform/blob/main/static/evidence/public-stats-2026-08-05.json).

## Browser smoke test

- The course catalog and a course-detail page rendered successfully.
- An anonymous visitor selecting **Buy Now** was redirected to `/signin`.

`/api/public/stats`.
